# Configuration

Releases are configured using a YAML file called `.kubri.yml`.

A simple configuration consists of a source that your releases are fetched from, a target to publish
your repositories to and one or more integrations, which are your repository generators.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
